<h2>Syntax Highlighting in Peasy</h2>
</div>

Syntax highlighting in P makes developing P programs easier, faster, and more enjoyable.

We created a Custom P theme that we suggest, but feel free to change the theme to whatever you like!

Here is a sample of syntax highlighting for the [Two Phase Commit](https://github.com/p-org/P/tree/master/Tutorial/2_TwoPhaseCommit) protocol from the P tutorial.
