  <h2>How to Run P Test Cases</h2>
</div>

Testing in P is made easy with this modification to the Peasy extension!

Navigate to the Testing Section of a P directory, and users will find names of P testing folders with P test cases under them. The Testing tab allows users to easily run test cases from anywhere in a P project directory by clicking the play button. Users can also navigate to the testing folders by pressing the icon to the right of the play button.

If an user navigates to a testing file, they can also click a green play button to run P test cases there too!
