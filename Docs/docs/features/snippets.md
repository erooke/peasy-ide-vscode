  <h2>Snippet Auto-Completion in Peasy</h2>
</div>

Coding in P became much easier with snippets! Snippets allow P developers to complete templates of repeating code patterns in P, such as state machines, different statements, test cases, and more. Snippets appear through **Intellisense** when users type out the beginning of P keywords such as **machine** or **test** or **send**.

After selecting a particular snippet, users can press `Tab` in order to jump to edit each placeholder in the snippet.

Snippets help P developers code faster and easier because they don't need to refer back to documentation for help when coding common data structures in P. Below is an example tutorial of coding with snippets in P!
