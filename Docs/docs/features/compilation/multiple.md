  <h2>Multiple Projects: Automatic Compilation</h2>
</div>
When working in a P project directory with a single project, the Peasy extension handles which project is compiled for you!

**But what if there are multiple projects within a single directory?**

To select another project that compiles after pressing `F5` and `Save`, press `F4`. This will trigger a pop-up that shows all the available P projects available to compile in your current working directory. Simply click or select the project you wish to compile automatically, and change the selected project later as needed!
