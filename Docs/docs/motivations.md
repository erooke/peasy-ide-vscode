  <h2>The Motivation Behind Peasy</h2>
</div>

Peasy brings the full power of an Intuitive Development Environment, including an editor, visualizer, checker, reviewer to P users.

Peasy achieves this by providing a VS code language extension for editing P programs and an intuitive interface for visualizing and reviewing the formal design and specification of a distributed system as a collection of P state machines.

Peasy enables the common interface of unit testing to model checking of P programs.

Peasy also provides a trace visualizer to debug counter examples reported by model checker as a message sequence chart and also the ability to single step through the error trace using the VS code debugger.

Peasy can also be used as a documentation tool leveraged by the service teams during design reviews to better understand/describe the complex system design.

  <h2>Transforming the User Experience</h2>
</div>

From the very beginning of users utilizing P to write formal models of their projects and problems, users clamored for a VS Code extension for the language P that would allow them to streamline the process of developing in P. Therefore, the P Team went to work to create a plugin that would suit all their users' needs. We aim for this extension to attract new users to develop in P with ease as well as transform the user experience for current P developers.
